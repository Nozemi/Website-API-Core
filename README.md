# Nozemi's API Core
Was originally going to make a webshop solution with this. I'm moving away from PHP and exploring other options, and thought I'd share shit thing with you. Although Laravel is probably a better choice than this.

#### Requirements
The foillowing requirements are needed in order to run this API Core. If not met, you won't be able to efficiently run this API.

- Composer
- PHP 7.0 (or higher)

#### Installation
1. Run `composer install `
2. You're ready to go, and it should be able to run out of the box.
